    "text": "Background and Motivation\nThe Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas) is one of the most important deep-water fisheries (DWF) globally, playing a crucial role in both the economy and food security. These extraordinarily large squid are particularly sensitive to environmental changes, including fluctuations in sea surface temperature (SST), driven by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (“ENSO”), that climate change increasingly intensifies. SST plays a pivotal role in determining where squid populations thrive, influencing their migration patterns and spawning grounds (@yu2018ocean). As these temperatures shift, so do the squid, leading to changes in fishing grounds and market demand (Powell, Levine, and Ordonez-Gauger (2022)). Understanding these dynamics is essential for sustainable fisheries management in an era of rapid climate change.\nThe urgency of this issue is highlighted by recent trends. From 2017 to 2020, the global squid fleet’s fishing effort increased by 68%, with most activity concentrated beyond a nation’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) particularly from international vessels (Seto et al. (2023)). This has led to significant geopolitical and environmental concerns, particularly around South America where the Humboldt squid is abundant (Montecalvo et al. (2023)). Although some regional fisheries management organizations, such as the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization (SPRFMO), have attempted to introduce regulations to moderate squid fishing, most squid stocks on the high seas remain largely unregulated. This lack of regulation, coupled with the sensitivity of squid populations to environmental changes, underscores the need for comprehensive research and effective management strategies.\nTo address these challenges and seize opportunities for sustainable management, it is crucial to understand how sea surface temperature (SST) changes will affect the Humboldt squid. While some research has begun to explore the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) on the Humboldt squid, few studies have connected these findings to policy implications (Yu and Chen (2018)). We propose to investigate the sensitivity of this fishery to climate change, with a particular focus on the implications for policy interventions. Our goal is to provide policymakers with the necessary data and insights to make informed, sustainable management decisions. Specifically, we will address the following research questions:\n\nHow do fluctuations in sea surface temperature influence the distribution and abundance of Humboldt squid?\nWhat are the subsequent shifts in fishing demand and potential conflicts among fisheries?\nWhat specific challenges and opportunities for management enhancement exist n light of changing SST?\nWhat policy recommendations and fisheries management strategies can be developed to manage Humboldt squid fisheries sustainably in the context of climate change?\nHow the relevant RFMO and DWF fleets or adjacent countries can collectively contribute to the sustainable management of jumbo flying squid in the context of climate change?"

    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nThe project will be conducted in three phases:\nPhase One: Literature review\nWe will begin with a review of scientific literature and existing studies on biological and ecological characteristics of Humboldt squid, including their life cycles, breeding patterns, and feeding behaviors. We will also compile information on how changes in SST have historically affected squid populations and identify key indicators of climate resilience. In addition, we will review socioeconomic studies that highlight the economic importance of Humboldt squid fisheries, their role in local economies, and the impact of environmental changes on these aspects.\nPhase Two: Structural model development\nIn the second phase, we will develop a data-driven fishery model to simulate future SST scenarios and predict Humboldt squid responses. This model will integrate historical and current data from Global Fishing Watch and SPRFMO, as well as bioeconomic parameters in the existing study of this fishery. We will use this model to analyze the migration patterns of these squid in response to changing SST to predict shifts in fishing demand and the potential for conflict among fisheries.\nPhase Three: Policy review and recommendations\nFinally, we will assess various fisheries management strategies specific to individual country and regions, such as voluntary seasonal closures and enforced fishing moratoriums, to identify their effectiveness in addressing the challenges posed by climate change and overfishing. This will help us develop evidence-based policy recommendations aimed at ensuring the future profitability, resiliency, and sustainability of the Humboldt squid fishery."

    "title": "1  Methods",
    "section": "1.1 Data sources",
    "text": "1.1 Data sources\n\n1.1.1 Sea surface temperature (SST)\nSea surface temperature (SST) data come from NOAA’s Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) version 2.1 (Huang et al. (2021)), which were downloaded from their Coast Watch ERDDAP server. The raw data are provided globally at 0.25x0.25 degree daily resolution. We spatiotemporally aggregate the data to 0.25x0.25 degree monthly resolution by calculating the mean from across days and 0.25x0.25 degree pixels.\n\n\n1.1.2 Sea surface temperature (SST) forecasts under climate change\nWe use SST forecasts under climate change from the IPCC WGI Interactive Atlas(Iturbide et al. (2021)). The Atlas provides a platform for accessing ensemble forecasts from CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6), which represent the latest global climate forecasts available and served as the basis of the 6th IPCC Assessment Report.\nWe pull 1x1 degree monthly SST data for three time horizons:\n\nNear Term (2021-2040)\nMedium Term (2041-2060)\nLong Term (2081-2100)\n\nAnd for each time horizon, we pull data from four climate change scenarios:\n\nSSP1-2.6\nSSP2-4.5\nSSP3-7.0\nSSP5-8.5\n\nThis gives us a total of 12 different forecasts to analyze.\nWe pull data for three dif\n\n\n1.1.3 Oceanic Niño Index (ONI)\nAccording to NOAA:\n\n“The Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) is NOAA’s primary index for tracking the ocean part of ENSO, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation climate pattern.”\n“The ONI is the rolling 3-month average temperature anomaly—difference from average—in the surface waters of the east-central tropical Pacific, near the International Dateline.”\n“Index values of +0.5 or higher indicate El Niño. Values of -0.5 or lower indicate La Niña.”\n\nWe downloaded these data from https://psl.noaa.gov/data/correlation/oni.data on September 27, 2024.\n\n\n1.1.4 AIS-based Fishing effort\nWe use satellite-based individual vessel monitoring AIS data processed by Global Fishing Watch (Kroodsma et al. (2018)). We use the V3 pipeline table pipe_ais_v3_published.messages. Variables of interest within this table include the following (descriptions are taken directly from the schema for pipe_ais_v3_published.messages):\n\nssvid: source specific vessel id; MMSI for AIS\nhours: time since the previous position in the segment\ntimestamp: timestamp for position\nlon: longitude\nlat: latitude\nnight_loitering: 1 if the seg_id of every message of a squid_jigger that is at night and not moving, 0 if not.\n\nIn order to minimize noisy data, we only include AIS messages that have a clean_segs boolean (i.e., all messages must have good_seg boolean and must not have an overlapping_and_short boolean). We filter to just those messages where night_loitering = 1. For squid jigging vessels, GFW uses the heuristic of night loitering to identify when they are fishing. Therefore, any hours where night_loitering = 1 can be classified as fishing_hours\nWe take the raw high-resolution AIS data and aggregate fishing_hours spatially (by 0.25x0.25 degree pixels, which are roughly 27.75km x 27.75km at the equator), temporally by month, and by flag. We currently process data from 2016-01-01 through 2024-08-31.\n\n\n1.1.5 Vessel info\nVessel characteristics data processed are by Global Fishing Watch (Park et al. (2023)). We use the V3 pipeline table pipe_ais_v3_published.vi_ssvid_v20240601. Variables of interest within this table include the following (descriptions are taken directly from the schema for pipe_ais_v3_published.vi_ssvid_v20240301):\n\nssvid: source specific vessel id; MMSI for AIS\nbest.flag: best flag state (ISO3) for the vessel\nbest.best_vessel_class: best vessel class for the vessel (using official registry information where available, or the GFW vessel characteristics algorithm where not available)\nbest.best_engine_power_kw: best engine power (kilowatts) for the vessel (using official registry information where available, or the GFW characteristics algorithm where not available)\nactivity.active_hours: hours the vessel was broadcasting AIS and moving more than 0.1 knots\nactivity.offsetting: true if this vessel has been seen with an offset postition at some point between 2012 and 2019\nactivity.overlap_hours_multinames: the total numbers of hours of overlap between two segments where, over the time period of the two segments that overlap (including the non-overlapping time of the segments), the vessel broadcast two or more normalized name, where each normalized name was bradcast at least 10 or more times. That is a bit complicated, but the goal is to identify overlapping segments where there were likely more than one identity. (this should be 0; if it is &gt; 0, it can be used as a filter to remove potentially erroneous/noisy vessels)\n\nWe filter to just those vessels where best.best_vessel_class = squid_jigger. Additionally, to reduce noise, we filter out vessels that broadcast exceedingly infrequently (i.e., activitiy.active_hours &lt; 24) or are noisy/spoofing/offsetting vessels (i.e., NOT activity.offsetting OR activity.overlap_hours_multinames &gt; 0.) They are simply not reliable and will not provide good effort estimates. This leaves us with 1,561 squid vessels for our analysis.\n\n\n1.1.6 Night light detections using VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite)\nAs an alternative to AIS-based fishing effort, we can use the NASA VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) data product to detect night light emissions from vessels. When the appropriate radiance threshold is applied, these can generally be assumed to represent light-luring squid vessels. Since use only the single most accurate VIIRS detection measurements each day, these can also be thought of as representing a fishing effort metric of vessel-days. We use the VIIRS data as an alternative fishing effort metric to AIS-based fishing effort since AIS is not used on all vessels, and since it can also be disabled on the vessels that do use it.\nWe leverage the VIIRS boat detection (VBD) dataset developed by Elvidge et al. (2015). This dataset is available through GFW as the BigQuery table pipe_viirs_production_v20180723.raw_vbd_global. Variables of interest within this table include the following (descriptions are taken directly from the schema for pipe_viirs_production_v20180723.raw_vbd_global):\n\nid_Key: Unique VBD ID.\nDate_Mscan: VBD pixel date-time at mid-point of DNB scan reported in Universal Time\nLat_DNB: VBD pixel latitude from VIIRS DNB geolocation file\nLon_DNB: VBD pixel longitude from VIIRS DNB geolocation file\nRad_DNB: Radiance of VBD pixel in VIIRS DNB band\n\nQF_Detect: Integer quality flag for VBD pixel, yielding information about quality and type of detection\nSATZ_GDNBO: Satellite zenith angle relative to the VBD pixel measured from the local vertical (from VIIRS GDNBO file)\nFile_DNB: VIIRS DNB HDF5 file\n\nWe then apply similar processing as Seto et al. (2023), which includes the following steps:\n\nReduce false detections near South America caused by the the South Atlantic Anomaly (an abundance of high-energy particles in the atmosphere).\nUse a same radiance threshold of 10 nW cm−2 sr−1 used by Seto et al. (2023) (and established by Park et al. (2020)) in order to filter detections to those likely engaged in in pelagic light-luring activity.\nTo eliminate double-counting when there may be multiple satellite overpasses on a single night, only count detections from the overpass with the smallest satellite zenith angle (smaller zenith angles are more accurate)\n\nWe then finally aggregate the total detections for each 0.25x0.25 degree pixel and month.\n\n\n1.1.7 EEZ information\nFor each 0.25x0.25 degree pixel, we determine a numer of EEZ features. To do so, we leverage the GFW table pipe_static.regions, which provides rasterized EEZ information for high resolution 0.01x0.01 degree pixels. We aggregate this raster up to our spatial resolution to determine the following fatures:\n\neez_id: Marine regions EEZ ID of the pixel; for high seas pixels, this takes a value of high_seas\ndistance_to_nearest_eez_m: For high seas pixels, this is the distance to the nearest EEZ pixel in meters (using distance on the surface of a WGS84 spheroid); for pixels within an EEZ, this is 0\nnearest_eez_id: For high seas pixels, this is the Marine regions EEZ ID of the nearest EEZ pixel; for pixels within an EEZ, this is the Marine regions EEZ ID of the pixel\npixel_sovereign1_iso3: ISO3 sovereign country code for the pixel; for high seas pixels, this takes a value of high_seas\nnearest_pixel_sovereign1_iso3: For high seas pixels, this is the ISO3 sovereign country code for the nearest EEZ pixel; for pixels within an EEZ, this the pixel’s ISO3 sovereign country code\n\n\n\n1.1.8 Joined datasets\n\n1.1.8.1 SST and AIS-based effort\nOne version of the final dataset we use for our analysis is a combination of the gridded AIS-based fishing effort data and gridded SST data. We inner join the AIS-based effort and SST datasets by 0.25x0.25 degree pixel and month. We finally left join the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) monthly data (by month) and the EEZ information (by pixel). Since the AIS-based effort dataset is disaggregated by flag, each row in the joined dataset represents flag-level effort in a given pixel and month, with the corresponding SST for that pixel and month.\nNote that the joined dataset does not contain flag-pixel-months with zero AIS-based fishing effort (i.e., the data are conditional on there being some effort for any given flag-pixel-month). If desired, once we have a spatial scope with which to restrict the analysis, we could construct a dataset for that bounding box that includes zero fishing effort flag-pixel-month rows.\nThe joined dataset can be loaded in R using the command targets::tar_load(joined_dataset_ais). The dataset has the following colums:\n\nmonth: Month (first day of month) (date)\n\nflag : Fishing vessel flag (character)\nlon_bin: 0.25 degree longitude bin (degrees) (numeric)\n\nlat_bin: 0.25 degree latitude bin (degrees) (numeric) * flag: Fishing flag (character)\n\nsst_deg_c_mean: Mean sea surface temperature, aggregated from the raw daily 0.25x0.25 degree data (degrees C) (numeric)\nfishing_hours: Total fishing effort across vessels (hours) (numeric)\n\nfishing_kw_hours: Total fishing effort across vessels (kW-hours) (numeric)\n\noceanic_nino_index: Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) (numeric)\neez_id: Marine regions EEZ ID of the pixel; for high seas pixels, this takes a value of high_seas (string)\ndistance_to_nearest_eez_m: For high seas pixels, this is the distance to the nearest EEZ pixel in meters; for pixels within an EEZ, this is 0 (meters) (numeric)\nnearest_eez_id: For high seas pixels, this is the Marine regions EEZ ID of the nearest EEZ pixel; for pixels within an EEZ, this is the Marine regions EEZ ID of the pixel (string)\npixel_sovereign1_iso3: ISO3 sovereign country code for the pixel; for high seas pixels, this takes a value of high_seas (string)\nnearest_pixel_sovereign1_iso3: For high seas pixels, this is the ISO3 sovereign country code for the nearest EEZ pixel; for pixels within an EEZ, this the pixel’s ISO3 sovereign country code (string)\n\nHere we summarize these data (Table 1.1):\n\n\nTable 1.1: Summary statistics for joined dataset that includes gridded SST and AIS-based fishing effort\n\n\n\n\n(a) Data summary\n\n\nName\njoined_dataset_ais\n\n\nNumber of rows\n110347\n\n\nNumber of columns\n13\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n5\n\n\nnumeric\n7\n\n\nPOSIXct\n1\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nflag\n9307\n0.92\n3\n3\n0\n45\n0\n\n\neez_id\n0\n1.00\n4\n9\n0\n63\n0\n\n\nnearest_eez_id\n0\n1.00\n4\n5\n0\n101\n0\n\n\npixel_sovereign1_iso3\n0\n1.00\n2\n9\n0\n49\n0\n\n\nnearest_sovereign1_iso3\n0\n1.00\n2\n3\n0\n65\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nlon_bin\n0\n1.00\n9.64\n108.94\n-180.00\n-83.25\n-58.00\n124.75\n179.75\n▂▇▁▃▆\n\n\nlat_bin\n0\n1.00\n2.91\n30.46\n-54.25\n-16.75\n-1.00\n31.50\n80.75\n▅▇▅▇▁\n\n\nfishing_hours\n0\n1.00\n64.48\n206.23\n0.00\n6.38\n15.14\n47.32\n15298.78\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nfishing_kw_hours\n0\n1.00\n78828.48\n294274.25\n2.41\n6818.36\n17709.45\n55348.18\n22738775.12\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nsst_deg_c_mean\n0\n1.00\n20.03\n6.74\n-1.64\n14.27\n20.44\n26.03\n34.25\n▁▅▇▇▃\n\n\noceanic_nino_index\n1489\n0.99\n-0.01\n0.86\n-1.27\n-0.81\n-0.08\n0.50\n2.48\n▇▆▆▂▂\n\n\ndistance_to_nearest_eez_m\n0\n1.00\n279966.10\n321312.00\n0.00\n19013.99\n159340.65\n424973.15\n1888741.50\n▇▂▁▁▁\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable type: POSIXct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nmedian\nn_unique\n\n\n\n\nmonth\n0\n1\n2016-01-01\n2024-08-01\n2021-02-01\n104\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.8.2 SST and VIIRS detections\nThe other version of the final dataset we use for our analysis is a combination of the gridded VIIRS detections data and gridded SST data, and the gridded VIIRS detections.

Both datasets show a peak occurring in spring and a dip occurring in winter. They both also show a smaller peak occurring in fall, although this peak is much more pronounced in the VIIRS data.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Comparison of monthly time series of AIS-based fishing effort and VIIRS detections.\n\n\n\n\nWe next compare the datasets by aggregating effort and detections across each month and pixel. There appears to be a generally strong relationship between the two, although there are many outliers that appear to have very low AIS-based fishing effort but actually have a very high number of VIIRS detections.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.11: Comparison of AIS-based fishing effort (x-axis) and VIIRS detections (y-axis) for each pixel and month. A linear regression line fit is shown in blue.\n\n\n\n\nWe can fit a simple linear regression to VIIRS detections against fishing effort and look at the residuals (Figure 2.12). We see that the residuals are generally fairly evenly spaced around 0, although for very low AIS-based effort there are many very high residuals, indicating pixel-months that have much more VIIRS detections than expected.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.12: Residuals of VIIRS detections when regressed against AIS-based fishing effort.
