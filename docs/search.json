    "section": "1.1 Data sources",
    "text": "1.1 Data sources\n\n1.1.1 AIS-based Fishing effort\nWe use satellite-based individual vessel monitoring AIS data processed by Global Fishing Watch (Kroodsma et al. (2018)). We use the V3 pipeline table pipe_ais_v3_published.messages. Variables of interest within this table include the following (descriptions are taken directly from the schema for pipe_ais_v3_published.messages):\n\nssvid: source specific vessel id; MMSI for AIS\nhours: time since the previous position in the segment\ntimestamp: timestamp for position\nlon: longitude\nlat: latitude\nnight_loitering: 1 if the seg_id of every message of a squid_jigger that is at night and not moving, 0 if not.\n\nIn order to minimize noisy data, we only include AIS messages that have a clean_segs boolean (i.e., all messages must have good_seg boolean and must not have an overlapping_and_short boolean). We filter to just those messages where night_loitering = 1. For squid jigging vessels, GFW uses the heuristic of night loitering to identify when they are fishing. Therefore, any hours where night_loitering = 1 can be classified as fishing_hours\nWe take the raw high-resolution AIS data and aggregate fishing_hours spatially (by 0.5x0.5 degree pixels, which are roughly 55.5km x 55.5km at the equator), temporally by month, and by flag. We currently process data from 2016-01-01 through 2024-08-31.\n\n\n1.1.2 Vessel info\nVessel characteristics data processed are by Global Fishing Watch (Park et al. (2023)). We use the V3 pipeline table pipe_ais_v3_published.vi_ssvid_v20240601. Variables of interest within this table include the following (descriptions are taken directly from the schema for pipe_ais_v3_published.vi_ssvid_v20240301):\n\nssvid: source specific vessel id; MMSI for AIS\nbest.flag: best flag state (ISO3) for the vessel\n\nbest.best_vessel_class: best vessel class for the vessel (using official registry information where available, or the GFW vessel characteristics algorithm where not available)\nbest.best_engine_power_kw: best engine power (kilowatts) for the vessel (using official registry information where available, or the GFW characteristics algorithm where not available)\nactivity.active_hours: hours the vessel was broadcasting AIS and moving more than 0.1 knots\nactivity.offsetting: true if this vessel has been seen with an offset postition at some point between 2012 and 2019\nactivity.overlap_hours_multinames: the total numbers of hours of overlap between two segments where, over the time period of the two segments that overlap (including the non-overlapping time of the segments), the vessel broadcast two or more normalized name, where each normalized name was bradcast at least 10 or more times. That is a bit complicated, but the goal is to identify overlapping segments where there were likely more than one identity. (this should be 0; if it is &gt; 0, it can be used as a filter to remove potentially erroneous/noisy vessels)\n\nWe filter to just those vessels where best.best_vessel_class = squid_jigger. Additionally, to reduce noise, we filter out vessels that broadcast exceedingly infrequently (i.e., activitiy.active_hours &lt; 24) or are noisy/spoofing/offsetting vessels (i.e., NOT activity.offsetting OR activity.overlap_hours_multinames &gt; 0.) They are simply not reliable and will not provide good effort estimates. This leaves us with 1,561 squid vessels for our analysis.\n\n\n1.1.3 Sea surface temperature (SST)\nSea surface temperature (SST) data come from NOAA’s Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) version 2.1 (Huang et al. (2021)), which were downloaded from their Coast Watch ERDDAP server. The raw data are provided globally at 0.25x0.25 degree daily resolution. We spatiotemporally aggregate the data to 0.5x0.5 degree monthly resolution by calculating the mean from across days and 0.25x0.25 degree pixels.\nWe can look at a map of SST, using August 2024 as an example (Figure 1.1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Map of mean sea surface temperature in August 2024, using 0.5x0.5 degree pixels.\n\n\n\n\nAggregating across the mean sea surface temperatures of each pixel, we can calculate the mean global sea surface temperature over time (Figure 1.2). This allows us to see both seasonal trends, and what appears to be a generally increasing trend over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Time series of global mean sea surface temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Night light detections using VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite)\nWe use the NASA VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) data product to detect night light emissions from vessels. When the appropriate radiance threshold is applied, these can generally be assumed to represent light-luring squid vessels. Since use only the single most accurate VIIRS detection measurements each day, these can also be thought of as representing a fishing effort metric of vessel-days. We use the VIIRS data as an alternative fishing effort metric to AIS-based fishing effort since AIS is not used on all vessels, and since it can also be disabled on the vessels that do use it.\nWe leverage the VIIRS boat detection dataset developed by Elvidge et al. (2015). We then apply similar processing as Seto et al. (2023), which includes the following steps:\n\nReduce false detections near South America caused by the the South Atlantic Anomaly (an abundance of high-energy particles in the atmosphere).\nUse a same radiance threshold of 10 nW cm−2 sr−1 used by Seto et al. (2023) (and established by Park et al. (2020)) in order to filter detections to those likely engaged in in pelagic light-luring activity.\nTo eliminate double-counting when there may be multiple satellite overpasses on a single night, only count detections from the overpass with the smallest satellite zenith angle (smaller zenith angles are more accurate)\n\nWe then finally aggregate the total detections for each 0.5x0.5 degree pixel and month.\nWe can compare AIS-based fishing effort with VIIRS detections by aggregating AIS effort across flags for each month and pixel, and then matching this with VIIRS detections by month and pixel. There appears to be a generally strong relationship between the two, although there are many outliers that appear to have very low AIS-based fishing effort but actually have a very high number of VIIRS detections.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: Comparison of AIS-based fishing effort (x-axis) and VIIRS detections (y-axis) for each pixel and month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Joined datasets\n\n1.1.5.1 SST and AIS-based effort\nOne version of the final dataset we use for our analysis is a combination of the gridded AIS-based fishing effort data and gridded SST data. We inner join the AIS-based effort and SST datasets by 0.5x0.5 degree pixel and month. Since the AIS-based effort dataset is disaggregated by flag, each row in the joined dataset represents flag-level effort in a given pixel and month, with the corresponding SST for that pixel and month.\nNote that the joined dataset does not contain flag-pixel-months with zero AIS-based fishing effort (i.e., the data are conditional on there being some effort for any given flag-pixel-month). If desired, once we have a spatial scope with which to restrict the analysis, we could construct a dataset for that bounding box that includes zero fishing effort flag-pixel-month rows.\nThe joined dataset can be loaded in R using the command targets::tar_load(joined_dataset_ais). The dataset has the following colums:\n\nmonth: Month (first day of month) (date)\n\nlon_bin: 0.5 degree longitude bin (degrees) (numeric)\n\nlat_bin: 0.5 degree latitude bin (degrees) (numeric) * flag: Fishing flag (character)\n\nsst_deg_c_mean: Mean sea surface temperature, aggregated from the raw daily 0.25x0.25 degree data (degrees C) (numeric)\nfishing_hours: Total fishing effort across vessels (hours) (numeric)\n\nfishing_kw_hours: Total fishing effort across vessels (kW-hours) (numeric)\n\nHere we summarize these data (Table 1.1):\n\n\nTable 1.1: Summary statistics for joined dataset that includes gridded SST and AIS-based fishing effort\n\n\n\n\n(a) Data summary\n\n\nName\njoined_dataset_ais\n\n\nNumber of rows\n52879\n\n\nNumber of columns\n7\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n1\n\n\nnumeric\n5\n\n\nPOSIXct\n1\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nflag\n5909\n0.89\n3\n3\n0\n45\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nlon_bin\n0\n1\n16.71\n110.75\n-180.00\n-82.00\n-4.00\n132.00\n179.50\n▂▇▁▃▇\n\n\nlat_bin\n0\n1\n4.14\n30.57\n-54.50\n-16.50\n0.50\n35.50\n80.50\n▅▇▅▇▁\n\n\nfishing_hours\n0\n1\n134.56\n457.20\n0.00\n8.04\n20.93\n77.50\n21005.80\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nfishing_kw_hours\n0\n1\n164498.37\n638360.25\n4.73\n8359.09\n23755.05\n90508.93\n31939325.02\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nsst_deg_c_mean\n0\n1\n20.04\n6.77\n-1.63\n14.28\n20.36\n26.11\n34.27\n▁▅▇▇▅\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable type: POSIXct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nmedian\nn_unique\n\n\n\n\nmonth\n0\n1\n2016-01-01\n2024-08-01\n2021-02-01\n104\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.5.2 SST and VIIRS detections\nThe other version of the final dataset we use for our analysis is a combination of the gridded VIIRS detections data and gridded SST data, and the gridded VIIRS detections.
