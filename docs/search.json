Keeping the full 0.25x0.25 degree spatial resolution, we temporally aggregate the daily data to monthly resolution by calculating the mean SST for each pixel from across the days in each month."

The Atlas provides a platform for accessing ensemble forecasts from CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6), which represent the latest global climate forecasts available and served as the basis of the 6th IPCC Assessment Report.\nWe pull 1x1 degree monthly mean SST data for three time horizons:\n\nNear Term (2021-2040)\nMedium Term (2041-2060)\nLong Term (2081-2100)\n\nAnd for each time horizon, we pull data from four climate change scenarios (more information on the scenarios can be found here:\n\nSSP1-2.6\nSSP2-4.5\nSSP3-7.0\nSSP5-8.5\n\nThis gives us a total of 12 different forecasts to analyze.

We use the V3 pipeline table pipe_ais_v3_published.messages. Variables of interest within this table include the following (descriptions are taken directly from the schema for pipe_ais_v3_published.messages):\n\nssvid: source specific vessel id; MMSI for AIS\nhours: time since the previous position in the segment\ntimestamp: timestamp for position\nlon: longitude\nlat: latitude\nnight_loitering: 1 if the seg_id of every message of a squid_jigger that is at night and not moving, 0 if not.\n\nIn order to minimize noisy data, we only include AIS messages that have a clean_segs boolean (i.e., all messages must have good_seg boolean and must not have an overlapping_and_short boolean). We filter to just those messages where night_loitering = 1. For squid jigging vessels, GFW uses the heuristic of night loitering to identify when they are fishing. Therefore, any hours where night_loitering = 1 can be classified as fishing_hours\nWe take the raw high-resolution AIS data and aggregate fishing_hours spatially (by 0.25x0.25 degree pixels, which are roughly 27.75km x 27.75km at the equator), temporally by month, and by flag. We currently process data from 2016-01-01 through 2024-08-31."

Variables of interest within this table include the following (descriptions are taken directly from the schema for pipe_ais_v3_published.vi_ssvid_v20240301):\n\nssvid: source specific vessel id; MMSI for AIS\nbest.flag: best flag state (ISO3) for the vessel\nbest.best_vessel_class: best vessel class for the vessel (using official registry information where available, or the GFW vessel characteristics algorithm where not available)\nbest.best_engine_power_kw: best engine power (kilowatts) for the vessel (using official registry information where available, or the GFW characteristics algorithm where not available)\nactivity.active_hours: hours the vessel was broadcasting AIS and moving more than 0.1 knots\nactivity.offsetting: true if this vessel has been seen with an offset postition at some point between 2012 and 2019\nactivity.overlap_hours_multinames: the total numbers of hours of overlap between two segments where, over the time period of the two segments that overlap (including the non-overlapping time of the segments), the vessel broadcast two or more normalized name, where each normalized name was bradcast at least 10 or more times. That is a bit complicated, but the goal is to identify overlapping segments where there were likely more than one identity. (this should be 0; if it is &gt; 0, it can be used as a filter to remove potentially erroneous/noisy vessels)\n\nWe filter to just those vessels where best.best_vessel_class = squid_jigger. Additionally, to reduce noise, we filter out vessels that broadcast exceedingly infrequently (i.e., activitiy.active_hours &lt; 24) or are noisy/spoofing/offsetting vessels (i.e., NOT activity.offsetting OR activity.overlap_hours_multinames &gt; 0.) They are simply not reliable and will not provide good effort estimates. This leaves us with 1,561 squid vessels for our analysis.\n\n1.5.1 Joined dataset: SST and AIS-based effort\nOne version of the final dataset we use for our analysis is a combination of the gridded AIS-based fishing effort data and gridded SST data. We inner join the AIS-based effort and SST datasets by 0.25x0.25 degree pixel and month. Since the AIS-based effort dataset is disaggregated by flag, each row in the joined dataset represents flag-level effort in a given pixel and month, with the corresponding SST for that pixel and month.\nThe joined dataset can be loaded in R using the command targets::tar_load(joined_dataset_ais). The dataset has the following colums:\n\nmonth: Month (first day of month) (date)\n\nflag : Fishing vessel flag (character)\nlon_bin: 0.25 degree longitude bin (degrees) (numeric)\n\nlat_bin: 0.25 degree latitude bin (degrees) (numeric)\n\nflag: Fishing flag (character)\n\nsst_deg_c_mean: Mean sea surface temperature, aggregated from the raw daily 0.25x0.25 degree data (degrees C) (numeric)\nfishing_hours: Total fishing effort across vessels (hours) (numeric)\n\nfishing_kw_hours: Total fishing effort across vessels (kW-hours) (numeric)\nHere we summarize these data (Table 1.1):\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Summary statistics for joined dataset that includes gridded SST and AIS-based fishing effort\n\n\n\n\n(a) Data summary\n\n\nName\ndplyr::select(…)\n\n\nNumber of rows\n41267304\n\n\nNumber of columns\n7\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n1\n\n\nnumeric\n5\n\n\nPOSIXct\n1\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nflag\n4585256\n0.89\n3\n3\n0\n8\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nlon_bin\n0\n1\n-102.56\n16.08\n-130.0\n-116.50\n-102.75\n-89.00\n-70.25\n▇▇▇▇▅\n\n\nlat_bin\n0\n1\n-15.81\n14.44\n-40.0\n-28.25\n-16.50\n-3.25\n10.00\n▇▇▇▇▇\n\n\nsst_deg_c_mean\n0\n1\n22.85\n4.19\n10.3\n19.96\n23.54\n26.27\n31.11\n▁▃▆▇▃\n\n\nfishing_hours\n0\n1\n0.07\n5.68\n0.0\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n3430.50\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nfishing_kw_hours\n0\n1\n74.70\n6175.53\n0.0\n0.00\n0.00\n0.00\n3745373.67\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable type: POSIXct\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nmedian\nn_unique\n\n\n\n\nmonth\n0\n1\n2016-01-01\n2024-08-01\n2020-04-16\n104"

The latitude range covers the maximum latitude of the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation (SPRFMO) and extends beyond the southern latitude where the north-south band of fishing effort is currently concentrated.
