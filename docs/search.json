    "text": "Background and Motivation\nThe Humboldt squid (Dosidicus gigas) is one of the most important deep-water fisheries (DWF) globally, playing a crucial role in both the economy and food security. These extraordinarily large squid are particularly sensitive to environmental changes, including fluctuations in sea surface temperature (SST), driven by the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (“ENSO”), that climate change increasingly intensifies. SST plays a pivotal role in determining where squid populations thrive, influencing their migration patterns and spawning grounds (@yu2018ocean). As these temperatures shift, so do the squid, leading to changes in fishing grounds and market demand (Powell, Levine, and Ordonez-Gauger (2022)). Understanding these dynamics is essential for sustainable fisheries management in an era of rapid climate change.\nThe urgency of this issue is highlighted by recent trends. From 2017 to 2020, the global squid fleet’s fishing effort increased by 68%, with most activity concentrated beyond a nation’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) particularly from international vessels (Seto et al. (2023)). This has led to significant geopolitical and environmental concerns, particularly around South America where the Humboldt squid is abundant (Montecalvo et al. (2023)). Although some regional fisheries management organizations, such as the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization (SPRFMO), have attempted to introduce regulations to moderate squid fishing, most squid stocks on the high seas remain largely unregulated. This lack of regulation, coupled with the sensitivity of squid populations to environmental changes, underscores the need for comprehensive research and effective management strategies.\nTo address these challenges and seize opportunities for sustainable management, it is crucial to understand how sea surface temperature (SST) changes will affect the Humboldt squid. While some research has begun to explore the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) on the Humboldt squid, few studies have connected these findings to policy implications (Yu and Chen (2018)). We propose to investigate the sensitivity of this fishery to climate change, with a particular focus on the implications for policy interventions. Our goal is to provide policymakers with the necessary data and insights to make informed, sustainable management decisions. Specifically, we will address the following research questions:\n\nHow do fluctuations in sea surface temperature influence the distribution and abundance of Humboldt squid?\nWhat are the subsequent shifts in fishing demand and potential conflicts among fisheries?\nWhat specific challenges and opportunities for management enhancement exist n light of changing SST?\nWhat policy recommendations and fisheries management strategies can be developed to manage Humboldt squid fisheries sustainably in the context of climate change?\nHow the relevant RFMO and DWF fleets or adjacent countries can collectively contribute to the sustainable management of jumbo flying squid in the context of climate change?"

    "title": "Toward sustainable and resilient fisheries management for the Humboldt squid deep-water fishery",
    "section": "Approach",
    "text": "Approach\nThe project will be conducted in three phases:\nPhase One: Literature review\nWe will begin with a review of scientific literature and existing studies on biological and ecological characteristics of Humboldt squid, including their life cycles, breeding patterns, and feeding behaviors. We will also compile information on how changes in SST have historically affected squid populations and identify key indicators of climate resilience. In addition, we will review socioeconomic studies that highlight the economic importance of Humboldt squid fisheries, their role in local economies, and the impact of environmental changes on these aspects.\nPhase Two: Structural model development\nIn the second phase, we will develop a data-driven fishery model to simulate future SST scenarios and predict Humboldt squid responses. This model will integrate historical and current data from Global Fishing Watch and SPRFMO, as well as bioeconomic parameters in the existing study of this fishery. We will use this model to analyze the migration patterns of these squid in response to changing SST to predict shifts in fishing demand and the potential for conflict among fisheries.\nPhase Three: Policy review and recommendations\nFinally, we will assess various fisheries management strategies specific to individual country and regionsY, such as voluntary seasonal closures and enforced fishing moratoriums, to identify their effectiveness in addressing the challenges posed by climate change and overfishing. This will help us develop evidence-based policy recommendations aimed at ensuring the future profitability, resiliency, and sustainability of the Humboldt squid fishery."

    "title": "1  Methods",
    "section": "1.1 Data sources",
    "text": "1.1 Data sources\n\n1.1.1 Fishing effort\nWe use satellite-based individual vessel monitoring AIS data processed by Global Fishing Watch (Kroodsma et al. (2018)). We use the V3 pipeline table pipe_ais_v3_published.messages. Variables of interest within this table include the following (descriptions are taken directly from the schema for pipe_ais_v3_published.messages):\n\nssvid: source specific vessel id; MMSI for AIS\nhours: time since the previous position in the segment\ntimestamp: timestamp for position\nlon: longitude\nlat: latitude\nnight_loitering: 1 if the seg_id of every message of a squid_jigger that is at night and not moving, 0 if not.\n\nIn order to minimize noisy data, we only include AIS messages that have a clean_segs boolean (i.e., all messages must have good_seg boolean and must not have an overlapping_and_short boolean). We filter to just those messages where night_loitering = 1. For squid jigging vessels, GFW uses the heuristic of night loitering to identify when they are fishing. Therefore, any hours where night_loitering = 1 can be classified as fishing_hours\nWe take the raw high-resolution AIS data and aggregate fishing_hours spatially (by 0.5x0.5 degree pixels, which are roughly 55.5km x 55.5km at the equator), temporally by month, and by flag. We currently process data from 2016-01-01 through 2024-08-31.\n\n\n1.1.2 Vessel info\nVessel characteristics data processed are by Global Fishing Watch (Park et al. (2023)). We use the V3 pipeline table pipe_ais_v3_published.vi_ssvid_v20240601. Variables of interest within this table include the following (descriptions are taken directly from the schema for pipe_ais_v3_published.vi_ssvid_v20240301):\n\nssvid: source specific vessel id; MMSI for AIS\nbest.flag: best flag state (ISO3) for the vessel\n\nbest.best_vessel_class: best vessel class for the vessel (using official registry information where available, or the GFW vessel characteristics algorithm where not available)\nbest.best_engine_power_kw: best engine power (kilowatts) for the vessel (using official registry information where available, or the GFW characteristics algorithm where not available)\nactivity.active_hours: hours the vessel was broadcasting AIS and moving more than 0.1 knots\nactivity.offsetting: true if this vessel has been seen with an offset postition at some point between 2012 and 2019\nactivity.overlap_hours_multinames: the total numbers of hours of overlap between two segments where, over the time period of the two segments that overlap (including the non-overlapping time of the segments), the vessel broadcast two or more normalized name, where each normalized name was bradcast at least 10 or more times. That is a bit complicated, but the goal is to identify overlapping segments where there were likely more than one identity. (this should be 0; if it is &gt; 0, it can be used as a filter to remove potentially erroneous/noisy vessels)\n\nWe filter to just those vessels where best.best_vessel_class = squid_jigger. Additionally, to reduce noise, we filter out vessels that broadcast exceedingly infrequently (i.e., activitiy.active_hours &lt; 24) or are noisy/spoofing/offsetting vessels (i.e., NOT activity.offsetting OR activity.overlap_hours_multinames &gt; 0.) They are simply not reliable and will not provide good effort estimates. This leaves us with 1,561 squid vessels for our analysis.\n\n\n1.1.3 Sea surface temperature (SST)\nSea surface temperature (SST) data come from NOAA’s Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) version 2.1 (Huang et al. (2021)), which were downloaded from their Coast Watch ERDDAP server. The raw data are provided globally at 0.25x0.25 degree daily resolution. We aggregate the data to 0.5x0.5 degree monthly resolution by calculating the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum SST for each 0.5x0.5 degree pixel and month.\nWe can look at a map of SST, using August 2024 as an example (Figure 1.1).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Map of mean sea surface temperature in August 2024, using 0.5x0.5 degree pixels.\n\n\n\n\nAggregating across the mean sea surface temperatures of each pixel, we can calculate the mean global sea surface temperature over time (Figure 1.2). This allows us to see both seasonal trends, and what appears to be a generally increasing trend over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Time series of global mean sea surface temperature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Joined dataset\nThe final dataset we use for our analysis is a combination of the gridded fishing effort data and the gridded SST data. We inner join these datasets by 0.5x0.5 degree pixel and month. Note that the joined dataset does not contain flag-pixel-months with zero fishing effort (i.e., the data are conditional on there being some effort for any given flag-pixel-month). If desired, once we have a spatial scope with which to restrict the analysis, we could construct a dataset for that bounding box that includes zero fishing effort flag-pixel-month rows.\nThe joined dataset can be loaded in R using the command targets::tar_load(joined_dataset). The dataset has the following colums:\n\nmonth: Month (first day of month) (date)\n\nlon_bin: 0.5 degree longitude bin (degrees) (numeric)\n\nlat_bin: 0.5 degree latitude bin (degrees) (numeric) * flag: Fishing flag (character)\n\nmean_sst: Mean sea surface temperature, aggregated from the raw daily 0.25x0.25 degree data (degrees C) (numeric)\nsd_sst: Standard deviation of sea surface temperature, aggregated from the raw daily 0.25x0.25 degree data (degrees C) (numeric)\nmin_sst: Minimum sea surface temperature (degrees C), aggregated from the raw daily 0.25x0.25 degree data (numeric)\nmax_sst: Maximum sea surface temperature (degrees C), aggregated from the raw daily 0.25x0.25 degree data (numeric)\nfishing_hours: Total fishing effort across vessels (hours) (numeric)\n\nfishing_kw_hours: Total fishing effort across vessels (kW-hours) (numeric)\n\nHere we summarize these data (Table 1.1):\n\n\nTable 1.1: Summary statistics for joined dataset that includes both gridded SST and fishing effort\n\n\n\n\n(a) Data summary\n\n\nName\njoined_dataset\n\n\nNumber of rows\n1610486\n\n\nNumber of columns\n10\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n1\n\n\nDate\n1\n\n\nnumeric\n8\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nflag\n179745\n0.89\n3\n3\n0\n45\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable type: Date\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nmedian\nn_unique\n\n\n\n\nmonth\n0\n1\n2016-01-01\n2024-08-01\n2021-02-01\n104\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\nmean_sst\n0\n1\n20.04\n6.81\n-1.65\n14.31\n20.41\n26.08\n35.46\n▁▅▇▇▃\n\n\nsd_sst\n302\n1\n0.17\n0.19\n0.00\n0.05\n0.11\n0.22\n2.45\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nmin_sst\n0\n1\n19.85\n6.90\n-1.68\n13.95\n20.24\n25.98\n35.45\n▁▅▇▇▃\n\n\nmax_sst\n0\n1\n20.23\n6.73\n-1.63\n14.66\n20.59\n26.17\n35.51\n▁▅▇▇▃\n\n\nlon_bin\n0\n1\n16.89\n110.83\n-180.00\n-82.00\n-0.50\n132.50\n179.50\n▂▇▁▃▇\n\n\nlat_bin\n0\n1\n4.22\n30.56\n-54.50\n-16.50\n0.50\n36.00\n80.50\n▅▇▅▇▁\n\n\nfishing_hours\n0\n1\n134.28\n456.21\n0.00\n8.03\n20.90\n77.28\n21005.80\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\nfishing_kw_hours\n0\n1\n164088.16\n636584.24\n4.73\n8351.48\n23717.34\n90379.80\n31939325.02\n▇▁▁▁▁\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuang, Boyin, Chunying Liu, Viva Banzon, Eric Freeman, Garrett Graham, Bill Hankins, Tom Smith, and Huai-Min Zhang. 2021. “Improvements of the Daily Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (DOISST) Version 2.1.” Journal of Climate 34 (8): 2923–39.\n\n\nKroodsma, David A, Juan Mayorga, Timothy Hochberg, Nathan A Miller, Kristina Boerder, Francesco Ferretti, Alex Wilson, et al. 2018. “Tracking the Global Footprint of Fisheries.” Science 359 (6378): 904–8.\n\n\nPark, Jaeyoon, Jennifer Van Osdel, Joanna Turner, Courtney M Farthing, Nathan A Miller, Hannah L Linder, Guillermo Ortuño Crespo, Gabrielle Carmine, and David A Kroodsma. 2023. “Tracking Elusive and Shifting Identities of the Global Fishing Fleet.” Science Advances 9 (3): eabp8200."
